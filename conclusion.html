            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
           
            <p>The data charts provided has revealed a compelling correlation between the 
                amount of time teenagers dedicated to the internet. Students who invest 
                more hours on the internet tend to yield to have low or high GWA depends on 
                how they use it. Girls spent so much time on the internet, yet they still get good 
                grades. On the other hand, men spend more time on the internet but donâ€™t 
                really get good grades. In our observation, this is because men use the 
                internet to play online games or do unnecessary things. The digital age has 
                provided an unprecedented platform for learning, socializing, and self-expression. On one hand, the internet opens doors to a wealth of information, 
                educational resources allowing the grade 9 students to broaden their horizons 
                and connect with the world in ways that were unimaginable in previous 
                generations</p>                
            <p id="second">The value of internet, where it helps the students with the learning process as it 
                helps to simplify the knowledge. In conclusion, the time Grade 9 students 
                spend online is a double-edged sword, offering both opportunities and 
                challenges. A concerted effort from educators and parents is necessary to 
                strike a balance that combines the benefits of online resources while 
                protecting student well-being. This approach aims to empower Grade 9 
                students to become responsible digital citizens, who can use the Internet for 
                learning and personal growth while minimizing the potential risks associated 
                with excessive online use</p>
