            <h1>Introduction</h1>
           
            <p>In the era of digital connectivity, the time grade 9 students spend on the 
                internet has become a compelling and influential aspect of contemporary 
                youth culture. The dataset at our fingertips serves as a comprehensive window 
                into this digital realm, capturing the nuances of how they allocate their time in 
                the vast online landscape. As we embark on this exploration, the dataset 
                unfolds as a repository of valuable insights, encapsulating the diverse online 
                activities that captivate the attention of teenagers. From social media 
                interactions and gaming endeavors to educational pursuits and content 
                consumption, each data point encapsulates a moment in the virtual lives of 
                adolescents.</p>                
            <p id="second">Understanding how grade 9 students navigate the internet is not merely an 
                exercise in data analysis but a venture into the evolving landscape of social 
                dynamics, information consumption, and digital citizenship. The dataset invites 
                researchers, educators to scrutinize the intricate relationships between online 
                behaviors and various facets of adolescent development</p>

            <h1>Variables:</h1>
            <h2>Qualitative variables</h2>
            <p>We have 2 variables: Self rating and Gender</p><br>
            <p><b>Gender:</b></p>
            <p><b>Piechart:</b></p>
            <div class="gender"><img src="images/genderpiechart.png" alt=""></div><br>
        
            <p><b>Histogram:</b></p>
            <div class="genderhistogram"><img src="images/genderhistogram.png" alt=""></div>
            
            <p>We had 52 respondents in total, and it seems that most of them were female, 
                or to be specific, 37 out of 52 (71%). The remaining 15 (29%) were male.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
           
            <p><b>Self Rating:</b></p>
            <p><b>Piechart</b></p><br>
            <div class="selfratingpiechart"><img src="images/selfratingpiechart.png" alt=""></div><br>

            <p><b>Histogram</b></p><br>
            <div class="selfratinghistogram"><img src="images/selfratinghistogram.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>For the self-ratings, we asked our batchmates to rate how well they're doing 
                academically on a scale of 1–10, and it seems that most people answered 8 
                (13 people, 25%), while the least answered were 1 and 2, because no one 
                answered them (0%). The second least answered was 3 — only one person 
                answered it (2%)</p>
            
            <h2>Quantitave variables</h2><br>
            <p>We have 2 Quantitative variables: Grades from last year and time spent on the internet in hours</p><br>
            <p><b>Grades from last year:</b></p>
            <p><b>Mean, Median and standard deviation</b></p>
            <div class="standartdeviation"><img src="images/gradesfromlastyearmean.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>The mean here is approximately 84.115. Meaning, the average grade 9 
                student (according to our sample survey), is on the Director’s List. This is due to 
                the fact that the frequency of 1.75(78) and 1.5(84) is equal and 1.25 had a 
                higher frequency than both of them. <br>
                The median here is 84. This means that at least 50% of the sample size had a 
                grade of 90 or more. br 
                The standard deviation is 5.246. This means that the grades of grade 9 students 
                deviated from the mean by ±5.246.
                </p><br>
            <p><b>Histogram:</b></p>
            <div class="gwafromlastyearhistogram"><img src="images/gwafromlastyearhistogram.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>Before we begin, there are some clarifications. <br>
                The Class Intervals (and their corresponding values) are: <br>
                72-74 = 1 <br>
                75-77 = 0 <br>
                78-80 = 16 <br>
                81-83 = 0 <br>
                84-86 = 16 <br>
                87-89 = 0 <br>
                90-92 = 19 <br>
                (Showing the Class Intervals helps comprehend the Class Boundaries)
                Moving on, the shape of the histogram roughly resembles another left-skewed 
                distribution. We can say this because the calculated skewness is negative (-
                0.2212261785). And also, when observing the graph, the peak (90, 19) is more 
                on the left side than the right side</p> <br>
                <p><b>Boxplot:</b></p>
                <div class="gwafromlastyearboxplot"><img src="images/gwafromlastyearboxplot.png" alt=""></div>
                <br>
                <p>In the graphing parts of GWA from Last Year, we can see that it is a positively 
                    skewed/right-skewed distribution due to its peak, and our own calculations 
                    and the box plot solidify this point. As for the more calculation-based parts, it 
                    shows that all measures of center used are of different values, not only that, it 
                    appears that they are of lower value than the general version of GWA from 
                    Last Year. Additionally, the values for standard deviation are still 
                    comparatively similar to the general ver.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Hours used in the internet:</b></p> 
                    <p><b>Mean, Median and standard deviation:</b></p>
                    <div class="hoursusedontheinternetmean"><img src="images/hoursusedontheinternetmean.png" alt=""></div>
                   <p>The mean here is 7.25. This means that the average hours a teenager in Grade 
                    9 of PSHS-SMC uses solely on the internet is 7.25 hours. <br>
                    The median here is 8. This means that at least 50% of the sample size goes on 
                    the internet for 8 hours per day or for longer hours. <br>
                    The standard deviation is 1.856. This means that the average hours of internet 
                    that Grade 9 students make up deviates from the mean by ±1.856 hours</p><br>
                    <p><b>Boxplot:</b></p>
                    <div class="gwafromlastyearboxplot"><img src="images/boxplot.png" alt=""></div>
                    <p>The Box Plot for hours used on the internet is rather one-sided. Meaning, the 
                        median (which is 8) is completely on the left side of the box. <br>
                        There is one reason for this, the number usually has the highest frequency in 
                        the distribution. <br>
                        From previous calculations shown here, the value ‘8’ has the biggest 
                        frequency of 18 observations and it is a LARGE number compared to the 
                        others. <br>
                        So, this is why Q3 and the Median merged. <br>
                        And since the median is at the third quartile, this means that at least 25% or 
                        more are just the number 8 or more than it</p> <br>

                        <p><b>Histogram:</b></p>
                        <div class="gwafromlastyearhistogram">
                            <img src="images/histogram.png" alt="">

                        </div>
                        <p>The shape of the histogram roughly resembles a left-skewed distribution. Yes, I 
                            must admit that there are many gaps in the graph. But, we can say this 
                            because the calculated skewness is negative (-0.2856962865). And also, when 
                            looking at it, the peak (7-8, 18) is more on the left side than the right side.</p>
